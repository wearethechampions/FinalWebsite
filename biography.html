		<br>
		<p id="subtext"> During World War II Ferdinand Marcos served as an officer with the Philippine armed forces, later claiming that he had been a leader in the Filipino guerrilla resistance movement. These claims were a principal element in his political success, but it was revealed in U.S. government archives that he actually played little or no part in anti-Japanese activities.</p>

			After Martial law was decreed, Ferdinand Marcos' wife, Imelda, became a powerful figure, often appointing her relatives to lucrative governmental and industrial positions while accumulating upward of 1,000 pairs of shoes and several Manhattan skyscrapers. 
			</div>
			<div class="right" id="subtext">
			These acts were akin to Marcos’ state-imposed "crony capitalism," by which private businesses were seized by the government and handed over to friends and relatives of regime members. These acts would eventually led to economic troubles for the Philippines and further civil unrest.

			Marcos' later years in power were marred by widespread government corruption, economic stagnation, a widening economic gap between the rich and poor and the growth of a communist guerrilla uprising. Change was coming to the Philippines.

			On August 21st, Benigno Aquino Jr. returned from his long exile to offer the Philippine people a new face of hope. Unfortunately, he was shot dead by his military escort as he stepped off the plane in Manila. The assassination was seen as the work of the government and ignited massive countrywide protests. An independent commission appointed by Marcos concluded a year later that high military officers were responsible for Aquino's assassination, although it has since been suggested that Marcos or even his wife had ordered the killing.

			To quiet the opposition and reassert his position of power, Marcos called for presidential elections. Corazon Aquino, the widow of Benigno Aquino, emerged as a formidable opponent and became the presidential candidate of the opposition.

			<div class="right" id="subtext">
			Marcos, however, managed to defeat Aquino and retain the presidency, but it was quickly revealed that his victory was only ensured through massive voting fraud carried out by his supporters. Marcos was discredited at home and abroad, and a tense standoff ensued between his supporters and those of Corazon Aquino.

			<div class="right" id="subtext">
			With his health failing and support for his regime fading fast, on February 25th, with the United States urging him on, Ferdinand Marcos went into exile in Hawaii. 
			</div>
			<div class="right" id="subtext">
			Evidence emerged that during his years in power Marcos, his family, and his close associates had looted the Philippines’ economy of billions of dollars through embezzlements and other corrupt practices. Marcos and his wife were subsequently indicted by the U.S. government on racketeering charges.
