				&emsp; &emsp; It starts with a letter M.  The Martial Law and the Marcos Regime. Millenials urged us not to forget history
				because this will shape us to learn to correct mistakes of the past. Same goes for the words of George Santayana who once
				said, “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”. Our history are lessons we are never bound to forget. 
				History may had mistakes but at least it taught us not to do the same mistakes again. History’s mistake is a prevention to
				the actions we are to make in the present. So in the present time, we can be more careful and cautious.

				&emsp; &emsp; The Martial Law was proclaimed on September 21, 1972 which enforced military power in the country and suspended 
				the common rights. Having the great need for extra powers to suppress the intensifying wave of brutality caused by communists 
				was Marcos’ justification of the declaration. It was also said to be intended to put a stop to the origins of rebellion and 
				promote development for the country. The autocrat also assured the whole country of the declaration of Martial Law stressing 
				the need for control over civil defiance that displays disorder. Marcos also explained that Martial Law is a tactical approach 
				to lawfully secure the country’s Constitution and look after the wellbeing of the Filipino people from various threats by Muslim
				rebel groups and Christian vigilantes that places the country’s national security in danger at that time. Marcos further explained
				that Martial Law was not a military invasion but was the only choice left for the country’s dilemma to be resolved dealing with the
				uprisings that brings nationwide chaos putting the country’s peace and order at risk. The emergency rule was said to have lead the
				nation to what Marcos calls a “New Society”, which was a part of his plan.

				&emsp; &emsp; This 2017 with the new president, Rodrigo Duterte, the spirit of Martial Law was once again felt. The present president declared Martial Law as a response to the rebellion that took place in Mindanao until now. This was after the Maute group, which was said to be inspired by the Islamic State, entered the city of Marawi because of the attempt to arrest Isnilon Hapilon who is an Abu Sayyaf. Some people said that the president’s declaration of the nightmare from the past, Martial law was just appropriate to aid the need of protection of the people in the place. But some were actually triggered upon hearing the same law again. They once believed this, the said New Society proposed by the late president Ferdinand Marcos, with the slogan, “Sa ikakaunlad ng bayan, disiplina ang kailangan.”. In return, they felt completely opposite of the slogan and didn’t wish for the same feeling again. This is why people were in a doubt for this law to come back and if this law can actually cure the problem that was the main cause of the proclamation or will just end up being a mistake that once made the people suffer and mourn.

				&emsp; &emsp; As authors of this website, we do not produce this for no reason. Though we are moving forward to forgiving measures of the past, it doesn’t mean we are forgetting those trials. Forgetting and forgiving are two different things. Because remembering our past keeps us from repeating these, that hinders us to evolve. We preserve these to retell to the next generations. We, ourselves make history. During one of the worst times, the Martial Law, we saw just how brave people strived to be despite circumstances. We are indeed bridged to our future, as to how history has made us all these years and we are now living our present not our history. Filipinos are this: we fall but countless times we rise after it all. The obstacles in the past that we have overcame defined our success. Once again, we are living in the present, not in the past but we are to keep the past within us because it had molded us to what we are today. The past could tell of what actions we could make for our present or even in the future, ensuring us no same mistakes could be made again. For us, Martial Law has a good purpose with it, but it depends on the people who would use it for their own will and to what extent that person in power would use it to his own good.

				&emsp; &emsp; Indeed, no one wants a mistake to be repeated again, that is why they tend to close doors to those who attempt to bring it back. But to remind ourselves, things are changing. And change is something inevitable. Everything is constantly changing, reason why we are actually making a progress. Prevention is good but things are even better if we think things well. It’s a nature of humans that we understand things further from the level of our own perception. It’s a matter of understanding one another, because one who cannot change his own mind could hardly change anything. The only way we’ll get to appreciate change is when we try to flow with it. We are learning to make a mad dash to a future unknown by living our present and learning from our past.
