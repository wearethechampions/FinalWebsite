			&emsp; &emsp; President Ferdinand E. Marcos signed Proclamation No. 1081 putting Philippines under the Martial Law. 
			The proclamation results in suspending civil rights and striking military authority in the Philippines. 
			<br>
			&emsp; &emsp; A need in an extra power to end the rising wave of violent students’ demonstrators, the threats of the 
			new Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), and the Muslim movement of the Moro National Liberation Front 
			(MNLF), was the justification of Ferdinand Marcos for the declaration of Martial Law as a need for the country.
			<br>
			&emsp; &emsp; The emergency proclamation also meant to destroy the roots of rebellion and advocate a quick trend for national development.
			<br>
			&emsp; &emsp; Martial Law is a calculated action to legally defend the Constitution and protect the comfort of the Filipino people 
			from the threatening ideas posed by Muslim rebel groups and Christian vigilantes that places national security at risk 
			during the time, Marcos explained citing the provisions from the Philippine Constitution.
			<br>
			&emsp; &emsp;  Martial Law was not a military takeover but instead an option to resolve the country’s dilemma on rebellion that stages 
			 national chaos menacing the peace and order of the country, Marcos cleared.
			<br>
			&emsp; &emsp; The declamation was to guide the country into what he called a <b> “New Society”. </b>

			<i> <br>
			&emsp; &emsp;MY COUNTRYMEN, AS of the 21st of this month, I signed Proclamation No. 1081 placing the entire Philippines under martial law.
			This proclamation was to be implemented upon my clearance and clearance was granted 9 o’clock in the evening of the 22nd, last night.
			<br>
			&emsp; &emsp;I have proclaimed martial law in accordance with the powers vested in the President by the Constitution of the Philippines. The 
			proclamation of martial law is not a military takeover. I, as your duly elected President of the Republic use this power which
			may be implemented by the military authorities but still is a power embodied in the Constitution to protect the Republic of the
			Philippines and our democracy. A republican, a democratic form of government is not helpless government. When it is imperilled by 
			the danger of violent overthrow, an insurrection or a rebellion, it has inherent and built-in powers wisely provided for under the Constitution.
			<br>
			&emsp; &emsp; Such a danger confronts the Republic of the Philippines. Article 7, Section 10, paragraph 2 of the Constitution provides and I quote:
			<br>
			&emsp; &emsp; “The President shall be Commander-in-Chief of all Armed Forces of Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary he may call out such armed 
			forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection of rebellion. In case of invasion, insurrection or rebellion or 
			imminent danger thereof, when the public safety requires it, he may suspend the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines 
			or any part thereof under law.”
			<br>
			&emsp; &emsp;Rest assured that I will continue to do so and I have prayed to God for guidance. Let us all continue to pray to Him. I am confident that with 
			God’s help, we will attain our dream of a reformed society, a new and brighter world. </i>

		&emsp; &emsp; The military or police can pick up anyone for any reason anytime at the time of the Martial law. You could 
		wind up a detainee, or you could just vanish, a "salvage" victim. You were labeled a "subversive" or a 
		"communist" or both, if you protested against the government and you were summarily arrested. 
		<br>
		&emsp; &emsp; People the government didn't like were tailed by security elements, their telephones tapped. A student was 
		murdered for speaking up with Imee Marcos. No two words were more invoked and abused for the purposes of
		oppression than "national security." People feared to speak out. The silence meant the people were happy, as 
		interpreted by Marcos logic, being what it was. Only Marcos and his cronies, who plundered the economy, were 
		protected by the law. Nobody else was.
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;The standards were Arbitrary arrest, detention, salvaging and torture. "We presume that priests and nuns
		charged with subversive activities are guilty until the courts decide whether they are guilty or not.", the
		Defense Minister, named Juan Ponce Enrile said in 1982. Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Enrique Fernando, 
		servilely held an umbrella over Imelda Marcos' head, on one occasion.
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;The media were strictly controlled and most of the women who were journalists who wrote against the regime
		were routinely "invited" for questioning by the military. 
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;The Times Journal, the Daily Express and the Bulletin Today, were among the only three national broadsheets, 
		all of them offering the same pro-administration pap

		&emsp;&emsp;Following the re-establishment of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) in 1968, threat to the country’s
		security was intensifying. In Tarlac and other parts of the country, The New People’s Army, supporters of CPP’s 
		military arm also grew in numbers. 
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;A window for Marcos to declare Martial Law was when there was an alleged attempt to the life of then Minister of
		Defense Juan Ponce Enrile. The day after the shooting incident, Marcos announced the emergency rule. Marcos 
		considered as a threat to national security the rebellion in the south caused by the clash between Muslims and 
		Christians. The Muslims were defending their ancestral land against the control of Christians who migrated in the area.
		The minority group organized the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in Malaysia and pushed for the autonomy of Mindanao 
		from the national government. Most Filipinos supported the move and was viewed by some critics as a change for the massive 
		corruption in the country to be solved.
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;To social and political values that hindered effective modernization, Marcos started to implement reforms on it. Marcos 
		imposed the need for self-sacrifice for the attainment of national welfare to match the accomplishments of its Asian 
		neighbors. His reforms targeted his rivals within the elite depriving them of their power and patronage but did not affect 
		their supporters.
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Thirty-thousand opposition figures including Senator Benigno Aquino, journalists, student and labor activists were detained
		at military compounds under the President’s command (Proclamation 1081 and Martial Law). The army and the Philippine 
		Constabulary seized weapons and disbanded private armies controlled by prominent politicians and other influential figures 
		(Proclamation 1081 and Martial Law). Marcos took control of the legislature and closed the Philippine Congress (Proclamation 
		1081 and Martial Law). Numerous media outfits were either closed down or operated under tight control (Proclamation 1081 and 
		Martial Law). Experts call this the “crony capitalism”, wherein Marcos allegedly funnelled millions of the country’s money
		by placing some of his trusted supporters in strategic economic positions to channel resources to him.

		&emsp;&emsp;It was generally thought to have been the work of the military, responsible for the assassination of Benigno Aquino as he returned
		to Manila in August 1983; it became the focal point of a more heavily supported opposition to Marcos’s rule. 
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Under mounting pressure both inside and outside the Philippines by late 1985, Marcos called a snap presidential election for February
		1986. Benigno’s widow, Corazon C. Aquino became the candidate of a coalition of opposition parties. Strong public outcry over the election
		results precipitated a revolt since Marcos was declared the official winner, which by the end of the month had driven Marcos from power.
		The presidency was then assumed by Corazon Aquino.
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;In establishing the new government, Aquino’s great personal popularity and widespread international support were instrumental. She abolished
		the constitution of 1973 and began ruling by decree, shortly after taking office. In February 1987, a new constitution was drafted and was ratified in a general referendum; the return of the form of government that had been present before the imposition of martial law in 1972 was marked in May 1987’s legislative elections and the convening of a new bicameral congress in July.
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;An enormous external debt, a severely depleted economy, and a growing threat from Moro and communist insurgents were what the new government 
		had inherited.  
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;The beginning of the end of the coalition that had brought Aquino to power was the resumption of active partisan politics. In the 1987 legislative elections, pro-Aquino candidates had won a sweeping victory, but in early 1988, there was less support for her among those elected to provincial and local offices. The criticisms against her administration by the early 1990s 
		-i.e., charges of weak leadership, corruption, and human rights abuses- had begun to stick.
